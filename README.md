# Hi, I'm Alex Gregory
I am a quantitative analyst and PhD candidate in archaeology. My area of expertise focuses on Bayesian inference, predictive modeling, and casual reasoning.

## I’m currently working on
- Bayesian models that link prehistoric human settlement, population size, and technological change
- Regression analysis of human technological change and dietary focus

### Skills
- **Programming**: R (Expert), Python (Intermediate), Git
- **Modeling**: Bayesian inference, GLMs, Spatio-temporal analysis, Machine learning
- **Data**: Wrangling, Missing data handling, Automation, Reproducible workflows
- **Visualization**: ggplot2, plotly
- **Soft skills**: Causal reasoning, Science communication

## What I value
- Data ethics and transparency
- Scientific communication
- Diversity of thought in scientific callaborations
- Neurodivergent inclusion in STEM

As a neurodivergent thinker, I bring a unique style of reasoning that emphasizes fairness, logical consistency, and precision to my work. I welcome and advocate for creative solutions to even the simplest of problems. Without creativity and the freedom to explore the road less travled, we cannot hope to build towards unfounded innovations.
